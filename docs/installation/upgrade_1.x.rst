Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x
==========================

.. note::

    v2.x was rewritten from scratch so the attachments from tickets will be lost in this new version.

The upgrade process is very simple and just follow these steps:

- Unzip the HelpDeskZ script package.
- Browse to directory **/hdz/app/Config/** and rename the file **Helpdesk.new.php** to **Helpdesk.php**. Edit this file
    and complete the required information (Site URL, database information, etc).
- Upload all files of v2.x to your HelpDeskZ directory.
- Open **/install** in your browser, for example http://support.mysite.com/install (modify your URL).
- The HelpDeskZ setup script will run. Click UPGRADE HELPDESKZ and follow the instructions through upgrade wizard.
- Now it's time to setup your help desk! Open the staff panel in your browser, for example: http://support.mysite.com/staff
    Use the login details that you entered in the installation process.
- Take some time and get familiar with all the available settings. Most should be self-explanatory.
- Thanks for using HelpDeskZ!
